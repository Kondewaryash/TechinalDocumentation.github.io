                <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                    intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                    of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A
                    more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
                    engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
                    Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

                <p>
                    The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser

                    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
                </p>


                <p>
                    Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically go inside the head element.

                    All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <code><!DOCTYPE html>
                 HTML Tags
                    </code>


                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="css">

            <header>CSS</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                    <code>
          p {
  font-size: 120%;
  color: dimgray;
}
        </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay, so now that we've seen how to make a change to every paragraph, let's look at how we can be a
                    bit more selective. Let's create a designation for paragraphs that should be in small caps. Here's
                    how we'd do that:
                    <code>
        p.smallcaps {
  font-variant: small-caps;
}

      </code>

                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="java_script">
            <header>Java Script</header>
            <article>
                <p>JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute JavaScript on users' devices.
                    <code>
         console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); // Prints 'HELLO'
        </code>
                </p>
                <p>Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it
                    can be changed anytime. JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must
                    have a unique name. You can assign a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you
                    declare it or before using it.


                    <code>
          var myName = 'Yash'; console.log(myName); // Output: Yash
        </code>
                </p>
